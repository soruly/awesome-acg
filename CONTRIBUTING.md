## Suggested Projects

To stay on the list, projects are suggested to be:

- Related to nijigen (二次元).
- Generally or potentially useful to the ACG community.
- Either:
    - free to use, or
    - open source (not limited to GitHub), or
    - has a documentated machine readable interface (e.g. database)

It's hard to define what is related and what is not. When in doubt, just open an issue to discuss.

## Formats

- Use the following format: `- [project-name](https://example.com) - Description.`
- Follow the original capitalization of the name of the project (no need to covert letter case).
- Descriptions begin with a capital letter, and end with a period.
- The descriptions should be either in english or japanese.
- Remove trailing whitespace.
- Links and categories should be sorted alphabetically.
- Add one link per pull-request.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing ones are also welcome.
